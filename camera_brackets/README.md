# Custom Camera accessories

The original (and current) Pick and Place structure is a [liteplacer kit](https://liteplacer.com/). It came with HD (720p) webcams to perform optical tasks such as fiducial identification, parts in feeder location, and parts in nozzle rotation determination. The parts in this 

## Bottom up camera dual polarizing filter holder

This design has been deployed and so far is working fine. It helps extracting the component shape from other objects such as the picking nozzle.  Extra filters and printouts can be found in the PnP part box. This parts are to be used together with the original [Lite Placer Up Looking camera design](http://a360.co/2Dw8c3k), [STL files here](http://www.liteplacer.com/Downloads/LitePlacer%20up%20looking%20camera%20holder%20STLs.zip) and a general discussion of lite placer [here](https://liteplacer.com/random-musings/).

The assembly includes next parts:
- Light filter mount
- Lens polarizer wheel
- Light polarizing filter 36x45x0.8mm polarizing sheet.(To be fit in the light filter mount)
- Camera polarizing filter: D16.5x0.8mm disk (To be glued to the lens polarizer wheel)

In addition to this parts two extra M4 bolts and washers are required (Computer chassis self taping bolts work fine too) to fix the lens polarizer wheel in the desired orientation.

This folder includes some models to help stabilize the camera position and reliability of the image processing pipelines. All the parts refer in this section can be found in the [Bottom up camera dual polarizing filter holder folder](./Bottom%20up%20camera%20dual%20polarizing%20filter%20holder/). The original Autodesk Fusion 360 version of the parts can also be accessed [here](https://a360.co/3xp3tlh) but not downloaded due to licensing restrictions.

## Integrated Top Down Camera Bracket: **Under test**

![Integrated Top Down Camera Bracket](./Integrated%20Top%20Down%20Camera%20Bracket/AssemblyV12.png)

This design needs to be tested. Further modifications might come. It is a collection of parts exported to stl and step that simplifies attaching the top down camera with the next improvements:

- Rigid part with an extra attachment point
- Integrated light ring and filter holder
- Optic alignment with the part picker column
- Collection of printable diffusers of different thickness
- Model holes are M4 and M3 and need to be tapped
